scrumble
========


This is my first project with pygame and github.
To run this script python 3.0 or newer is needed (This is preinstalled on Ubuntu).
The pygame libary for python is also needed. Install on Ubuntu with:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

To run this game simply open a terminal in the scrumble folder and type:

```
$ python scrumble.py 
```

I do not own any rights for the music, but I consider this use of the music as fair use.
However this music will be replaced in a final version. If you want to chek out more awesome music from naph here is his soundcloud:
